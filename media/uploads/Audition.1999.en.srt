1
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:35,832
"Dear Mom, get well soon"

2
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,360
Tell the head nurse to stay.

3
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,506
Ryoko, Ryoko...

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,340
Ryoko, Ryoko...

5
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,079
Hello!

6
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,334
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,771
5:28 PM.

8
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,771
I brought this for Mom.

9
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:20,164
7 years later

10
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:28,325
Hey, let's go home.
The waves are too high.

11
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,765
Dad, no luck again?

12
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:41,531
You don't understand.
I'm only after the big ones.

13
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:47,966
I prefer real-life girls
to imaginary big fish.

14
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,146
Well...

15
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,349
When you grow up,
you'll understand.

16
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,938
It's called romanticism.

17
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,673
Hello.

18
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:05,987
I have done the planning.
I'll bring it tomorrow.

19
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,797
Yes... Hello?

20
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,179
Sorry I have to go.

21
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:34,336
This is too big for us.
We'll share it with Rie.

22
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:46,046
You don't bring friends home anymore.
Is everything OK?

23
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:50,371
Did you know that
black sea bream originate as males?

24
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:51,838
What?

25
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:55,358
When they reach 15 cm long,
they become unisex.

26
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,660
Then some become female.

27
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,798
Oh really?

28
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,769
What about this one?

29
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,315
We saw ovaries.

30
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:10,971
Did we?

31
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:15,613
I don't know very much
about ovaries.

32
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,475
You don't look young anymore.

33
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:22,882
What?

34
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,510
You look very plain.

35
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,607
Gang.

36
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,374
Hey, Dad, why don't you
get remarried?

37
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,888
Why do you say that?

38
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:56,919
I just simply think so.

39
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,542
Thanks for the dinner.

40
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,991
It's your turn for the dishes.

41
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,113
It looks like a ceremony for
a religious cult.

42
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,495
They're pretty much the same.
Lonely.

43
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,907
Happy people wouldn't go to
that kind of concert.

44
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,794
The whole of Japan is lonely.

45
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,164
Are you?

46
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,557
You too, right?

47
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,733
Boss.

48
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:41,953
Mr. Ueno wants to change tomorrow's
meeting from 1:00 to 3:30 pm.

49
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,626
That's okay by me.
I'll be here.

50
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:49,405
I'll drop in at Starts and
then meet Yoshikawa tonight.

51
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:50,939
I won't be back at the office.

52
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:54,622
Any changes and I'll call you
on your cell phone.

53
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,031
Yeah.

54
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:06,974
Well...

55
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,661
I'm going to marry soon.

56
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,054
Really?

57
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,806
Congratulations.

58
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,779
To whom?

59
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,366
Someone you don't know.

60
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,475
Congratulations anyway.

61
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,617
- You're a busy man.
- It's all right, but...

62
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,714
The profit margins are getting thinner.

63
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,697
How about you?

64
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:03,711
Don't you know?

65
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:06,396
The movie industry is profitable.

66
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,410
Really?

67
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,021
I'm lying.

68
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,967
It's like a survival game,
or a game of torture.

69
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,187
- Is it no good?
- Seems like a bright future ahead.

70
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:23,333
But I don't know how long
we can hang in there.

71
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,154
Yoshikawa. Didn't you say
the same thing a year ago?

72
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:31,360
Did I?

73
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,742
Awful girls.

74
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,303
No class and stuck up.

75
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:47,069
Stupid as well.
Where are all the good girls?

76
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,629
Japan is finished.

77
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:56,986
Let me say...

78
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:01,694
I intend to get married again.

79
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:05,559
Well, what made you
decide to do that?

80
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,295
Who's she?

81
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,050
I haven't found her yet.

82
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:15,447
My son said to me that I look old
and that I should get married again.

83
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,826
That's the story.

84
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,182
You look old...

85
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,783
How are you going to look for one?
An arranged marriage?

86
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:31,319
No, that's not my style.

87
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:36,632
I wish there was a very nice woman
hiding somewhere.

88
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:46,299
What is your ideal woman like?
Preferably young?

89
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,529
Not too young.

90
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:57,338
She could possibly have a job,
and some training.

91
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,882
Training?

92
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:04,646
For instance, playing the piano,
singing or dancing.

93
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,827
Your ex-wife Ryoko
was like that.

94
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,564
Certain training gives people
confidence.

95
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:23,194
A lack of confidence brings
unhappiness.

96
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,464
Pianist.

97
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,929
It'll cost you more.

98
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:32,285
She need not necessarily be
a professional.

99
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,148
I don't want to fail at marriage
at my age.

100
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,888
I'd like to have enough time
to observe her.

101
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:46,498
I'd like to see many women
and then choose my ideal one.

102
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,361
What are you laughing at?

103
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,935
Am I expecting too much?

104
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:57,796
I probably am.

105
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,385
No, I can handle that.

106
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,850
I have an idea.

107
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,686
Have an audition.

108
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,876
It'll be a romantic story.
Remember your documentary?

109
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:19,480
Love triangle between dancer,
patron and a Down syndrome boy.

110
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,419
Teamed up with a German TV station.

111
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,641
I'll rearrange the story.
Any problems?

112
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:34,719
I don't see any problems,
but we're going to audition?

113
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:40,032
Trust me.
Have I ever disappointed you?

114
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:41,950
Well no, but...

115
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,220
The heroine is supposed to be
in her early 20's to 30.

116
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:49,536
The conditions are that she be a well
trained person. No problems, huh?

117
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,989
Wouldn't it be fraudulent?

118
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:58,877
This audition is not only about finding
you a wife. It's part of making a movie.

119
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,824
Collect enough money,
we have the movie.

120
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,123
The story isn't bad.

121
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,175
Well...

122
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:11,709
Am I supposed to marry
the main girl?

123
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,159
No, a girl with that much talent
wouldn't marry you.

124
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,806
They aren't the marrying type.

125
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:24,570
Really good ones will always fail
the second interview.

126
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:25,826
Really?

127
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,786
They are quite attractive.

128
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:39,866
Smart, with a good upbringing.
Traditional and well trained.

129
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,935
Wishing her to be your son's wife?

130
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,496
I don't get it.

131
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,958
Why can't she get the main part?

132
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:51,490
They are not unhappy.

133
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:55,681
Happy people can't act well.

134
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:03,325
And another thing. I have a plan to
work with FM, I'll combine this.

135
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:07,314
Make another program called
"Tomorrow's Heroine".

136
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,375
Trust me.
I'm a pro at auditions.

137
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,635
This is Yoshikawa.
I'm in room number 2. Coffee?

138
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,498
Is coffee OK for you?
Bring two coffees please.

139
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,389
I'm in a middle of a traffic jam,
I might be late...

140
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:37,409
Please hand that tape to
Mr. Kaneda.

141
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,065
Thanks.

142
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,145
Tomorrow's heroine.

143
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:53,204
I'm just wondering
where you are?

144
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:59,390
Wonderful things might happen. If you
encourage yourself a little bit more.

145
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:06,362
Every star has their defining moment.
Hepburn and Julia Roberts.

146
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:10,198
They led their own lives
prior to becoming heroines.

147
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,387
Tomorrow's heroine is living
at the same time as you are.

148
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:22,330
No, tomorrow's heroine could
be you yourself.

149
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,215
I'm home.

150
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:41,722
- Here we go.
- You're home early.

151
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,964
That's right, I've got to work
at home tonight.

152
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:50,142
Please heat up your dinner.
The bigger dish is for Shigehiko.

153
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:53,221
- Thanks.
- See you on Monday.

154
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:57,853
My daughter's here this weekend.
I've got to go shopping.

155
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,059
That's nice.
Hey Gang.

156
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,384
Please put your washing in the basket.
Good bye.

157
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,549
- Thanks.
- Bye.

158
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,668
- Hello.
- It's me.

159
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:04,255
Yoshikawa. I'm checking
the applications.

160
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,841
They're all good, right?

161
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,651
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

162
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:14,488
It's like buying my first car.

163
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,113
Don't mix your car and wife.

164
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:22,620
I intend to hold the audition next week.
Choose 30 applicants.

165
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,277
- 30 applicants?
- That's right.

166
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,329
Alright. I'll let you know.

167
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:32,441
Don't trust pictures.
Composition can be more useful.

168
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:33,975
Understood.

169
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,248
- See you.
- Bye.

170
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,297
Choose 30 from all of you?

171
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,051
You're home?

172
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,792
Why don't you knock at the door?
You just arrived?

173
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,815
Yeah. Dinner?

174
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:58,488
I'll eat later. Why don't you eat first?

175
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,869
Alright.

176
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,293
I'm having a guest tonight.

177
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:09,019
Girlfriend?
Give her my dinner.

178
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,649
Thank you.

179
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,040
What did I do!

180
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,529
Asami Yamazaki.

181
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:58,265
Classical Ballet for 12 years.

182
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:09,381
I'm not sure that I can make
an actress of myself.

183
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:12,056
And you probably won't choose me.

184
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,480
I was simply attracted to this story.

185
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:22,174
I studied ballet, but damaged
my hips when I was 18.

186
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:28,063
I was devastated as I intended
to practice in London.

187
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:33,692
Ballet was my priority.
So my dream collapsed.

188
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:39,936
It might sound exaggerated,
but it's like accepting death.

189
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:44,059
Living is another way of
reaching death.

190
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:50,428
I think I know these facts very well.
That's why I applied for this part.

191
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:11,363
- When was this dinosaur living?
- About the later Cretaceous period.

192
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:15,708
The later part of Cretaceous means...

193
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,544
That's a Sauropod, right?

194
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:23,553
Good. What about the dinosaur
that has the Syracuse model?

195
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:26,200
- I don't know.
- Do you want to see?

196
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:39,291
- Hi! Good evening.
- Good evening.

197
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,247
I'm his father.

198
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,150
My name is Misuzu. Nice to meet you.

199
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,560
Nice to meet you too.

200
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:51,355
I often see her on the train. I thought
she was pretty, so I talked to her.

201
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:52,899
Good job.

202
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:59,354
I'm interested in biology.
He showed me his books.

203
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,723
- We ate your dinner.
- Fine.

204
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,293
Was it his?

205
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:09,059
I'm sorry I ate your meal.
Terribly sorry.

206
00:22:09,414 --> 00:22:14,363
- I will cook something for you.
- Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

207
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:17,364
Gang.

208
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:26,360
Good boy.

209
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,180
Let's go for a walk.

210
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,316
Shigehiko, make sure
she gets home alright.

211
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,505
Of course.

212
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:35,519
OK boy, come on.

213
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:42,913
Let's go, Gang.

214
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,102
Ready?

215
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,926
Well... I feel like a criminal.

216
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,467
I'm ready.

217
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,524
Let's start.

218
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:13,890
Pleased to meet you.

219
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:16,192
Please sit.

220
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,178
My name is Yu Tanaka.

221
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,933
Please have a seat.

222
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:30,395
- Are you nervous?
- A little bit.

223
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,081
- Sorry, you are the first one.
- That's OK.

224
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,737
We're going to tape you.
But don't worry.

225
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:38,240
Do you mind if I ask what
your father's job is?

226
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,846
Well... my father's...
job is...

227
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:43,745
What can I say?

228
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:46,747
Next one.

229
00:23:46,948 --> 00:23:51,897
I'm going to ask you frankly.
Why did you apply for this part?

230
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,621
Have you ever had sex with
someone you don't like?

231
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:56,414
Are you interested in drugs?

232
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,222
Can you act a little bit for us?

233
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,358
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

234
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,371
What music do you like?

235
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:12,631
- Which actress do you like?
- I like Mituko Mori.

236
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,600
Next.

237
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:22,452
I used to love sports.
At school, I played...

238
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,080
Did you ever want to work for
the sex industry?

239
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:29,434
I have a friend who is
working in that area.

240
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,285
Next.

241
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:44,606
What are men to you?
Have you ever seen Tarkovsky's films?

242
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,754
Ren Osugi.

243
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,590
We have some sex scenes.
Can you handle that?

244
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,576
No problem.

245
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:54,494
Are you psychic?

246
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:05,465
Next.

247
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,326
May I ask you a question?

248
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:09,052
Can you smile?

249
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,380
What kind of men
don't you like?

250
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:15,228
Yoko Sugimura.
Nice to meet you.

251
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:19,966
If I didn't have confidence
I wouldn't be an actress.

252
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:21,913
Excuse me.

253
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,786
When I was 2, mother decided
that I'd be an actress.

254
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:32,606
Can you walk around the chair?

255
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,608
Turn around.

256
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,017
Next please.

257
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,342
Nice meeting you.

258
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,148
It's time for a break
from our schedule.

259
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:58,462
We're 30 minutes late.
Let's take a 10 minute break.

260
00:25:58,653 --> 00:25:59,833
Sure.

261
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,366
You don't seem too enthusiastic.

262
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:12,924
Don't tell me you're not
interested anymore.

263
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:15,648
It's not like that.

264
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,275
Then what?

265
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:24,375
I'm nervous myself.
I need to use the toilet.

266
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:52,638
I lived in Paris for 3 years. And have
come back to Tokyo as a designer.

267
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:55,448
I can't think about anything else
but being an actress.

268
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,018
My office was only for adult videos.

269
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,157
Keep her for another job.

270
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:03,935
I'm not satisfied being called
a cover girl queen.

271
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,384
This scar is from my first suicide attempt
and this is from the second.

272
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,607
I've been to an asylum 3 times.

273
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,071
Next.

274
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:21,438
Emi Kitani.
Pleased to meet you.

275
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:24,603
We finished your interview before.

276
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,585
But I haven't finished
what I have to say.

277
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,383
You have a nice career,
why do you want to be an actress?

278
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:37,022
I think I've been doing
very well, but...

279
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,928
Sorry.

280
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:43,803
I'm a children's nurse.
My work is very hard...

281
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:47,715
Next please.

282
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,142
Ms. Asami Yamazaki.

283
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:53,978
Please.

284
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,838
- Asami Yamazaki.
- Have a seat.

285
00:28:13,504 --> 00:28:16,122
- Sorry for the delay.
- It's OK.

286
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:21,148
Have you done any movies
or TV jobs?

287
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:25,636
I've had many opportunities,
but actually haven't done any.

288
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,587
Do you belong to any agency?

289
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:36,320
Not really. But I'm on keep
for a record company director.

290
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:38,717
But we haven't contacted
each other recently.

291
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:42,390
- Which record company?
- Ace Records.

292
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,166
Could you tell me your
personal contact's name?

293
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:51,549
Japanese music dept.
Director Shibata.

294
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:02,233
Since you quit your previous job,
you're unemployed?

295
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,395
How do you manage your daily
expenses? If you don't mind telling us.

296
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,787
I help at a friend's shop.
3 times a week.

297
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,216
What kind of shop?

298
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,516
A small bar in Ginza.

299
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:20,694
The owner used to be a class mate
in voice training.

300
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,952
If I keep my costs low,
I have no money problems.

301
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,156
Don't you want to lead
a luxurious life?

302
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:32,155
Too poor isn't good.

303
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:37,698
But I can afford books and CDs.
That's enough for me.

304
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:41,429
Can I ask you about ballet?

305
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:43,644
Certainly.

306
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,972
- You damaged your hips.
- That's correct.

307
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:51,134
It must have been awful to quit
what you'd been doing.

308
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,232
Yes.

309
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:58,807
I must sound a bit rude but...

310
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:03,678
Your writing says that quitting
what you liked...

311
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,802
...is almost similar to accepting death.

312
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:11,840
I was highly impressed.

313
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:16,443
I think everybody has
similar experiences.

314
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:21,373
In your lifetime when you have
something beyond your control.

315
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:25,468
What can you do but accept it?

316
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,796
I think that's life.

317
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,685
I mean...

318
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:36,065
I was amazed a young girl like you
understands that.

319
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:41,877
I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way.

320
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,447
That's what I thought.

321
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:57,979
Thank you very much.

322
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:06,908
Are you finished?

323
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,183
Thank you for coming.

324
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,798
- We may contact you later.
- Yes.

325
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:20,565
Excuse me.

326
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,516
- May I call the next one?
- Let's have a 15 minute Break.

327
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:36,763
Fine.

328
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:40,446
Please tell Mr. Ito I'll be late.

329
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,827
- What do you think?
- She made me very nervous.

330
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,455
I wanted a cigarette.

331
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:00,029
You decided on her
before the audition.

332
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:05,822
I like her much more than
her nice writing.

333
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:10,013
"I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way."

334
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:13,437
It's not an interviewer's comment.
I was stunned.

335
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,493
Don't joke about that.
She really impressed me.

336
00:32:23,037 --> 00:32:26,719
I'm sure she's a serious type of girl.

337
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:32,406
She is better than her photo
and may also be good-hearted.

338
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:37,432
But I don't like her.

339
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,443
What's wrong with her?

340
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:43,100
Something chemical.

341
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:48,739
Can't say exactly what's wrong.
I just don't like her.

342
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,187
Your girlfriend seemed nice.

343
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,173
Misuzu?

344
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:17,213
- She looked nice, but...
- What?

345
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:21,279
One of those girl things.
I don't understand girls.

346
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,775
Don't you?

347
00:33:26,592 --> 00:33:27,964
Thanks.

348
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:32,260
Hey, Dad, about your remarriage.

349
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:35,674
Preferably someone
who cooks better than Rie.

350
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:40,575
Why are you in such a hurry?

351
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:44,660
New discovery of another dinosaur,
from Argentina.

352
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:48,161
- That one could be older than Euraptile.
- Really.

353
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:50,683
I'll be busy collecting information.

354
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,366
Take a bath.

355
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,426
Yes, hello.

356
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:33,178
Sorry for calling so late.

357
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,849
This is producer Aoyama.
I interviewed you today.

358
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,519
- Thank you for your time today.
- Not at all. Well...

359
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:51,544
I wondered if you might have
some time to talk with me.

360
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:55,198
Of course. I'd love to see you.

361
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:57,595
When would be good for you?

362
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,432
Anytime would be fine,
during the daytime.

363
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:05,719
Really. Let me see.
For instance...

364
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:12,672
Good night.

365
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:29,177
This is the Aoyama residence.

366
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,351
- It's me.
- How is it?

367
00:35:33,022 --> 00:35:37,118
About Ms. Yamazaki.

368
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,874
Not that I doubted her,
I called Ace Records.

369
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:48,310
It's no big deal, but something
didn't seem right.

370
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:50,467
What is it?

371
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,704
Director Shibata isn't
at the company.

372
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:59,876
To be precise,
he isn't there anymore.

373
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,807
He's been missing for a year.

374
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:12,535
He just disappeared.

375
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,926
I'm nervous.

376
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:27,477
Please relax, I won't ask you
any special questions.

377
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:34,813
You only ask of me to enjoy
this nice food and talk?

378
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:36,473
Absolutely.

379
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:40,472
That's the best request
I've ever had.

380
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,663
Just one question.

381
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:49,180
Your director contact.

382
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,632
Mr. Shibata?

383
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:59,096
I'm sorry I said so at the audition, but...

384
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:02,491
In fact I've never met him.

385
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:07,392
I don't belong to any actors' agency.

386
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:10,969
I was advised to answer you like that.

387
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:13,952
Is that so?

388
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,308
I didn't mean to tell a lie.

389
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,458
It's OK. I've clarified that question,
that's no problem.

390
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:26,649
Here we go.

391
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:30,236
Looks wonderful.

392
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:36,921
Go ahead.

393
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,313
- Yummy.
- Good.

394
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:01,491
I hope I'm not asking you
too much, and...

395
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:04,148
You probably can't, but...

396
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:08,416
If you have some free time...

397
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:13,499
I'd like to talk to you more.

398
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:19,771
I don't have anybody to be
frank with.

399
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:22,264
If I'm good enough,
I'd love to.

400
00:38:22,974 --> 00:38:26,551
Really? I'm very happy about that.

401
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,371
I'll try not to bother you.

402
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:33,466
I don't mind any place.

403
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:36,247
Even on the telephone
would be fine.

404
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:40,601
I'll write my cellular phone number
on my business card.

405
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,066
Please call me anytime.

406
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,794
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the meal too.

407
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:52,637
I've decided.

408
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:59,168
I don't care about the movie,
I'm interested only in her.

409
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:07,809
Don't worry about the movie.
I'll handle that matter.

410
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:12,249
But don't be too hasty.

411
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,970
You wanted to have some time
to observe your prospect.

412
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:21,370
Why are you so negative about her?
What's wrong with her?

413
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,944
I only think that
life isn't so easy.

414
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:31,421
She is beautiful, classy
and obedient.

415
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:38,134
Such a woman not having
any boyfriends is unthinkable.

416
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:43,552
I checked out her associates,
none are accessible.

417
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:48,156
The bar she was talking about
is also an unknown.

418
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:53,939
We can't reach anybody
who knows her.

419
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:58,360
I wasn't born yesterday.
I won't be fooled that easily.

420
00:39:58,753 --> 00:40:01,755
I trust myself over some
other's evaluation.

421
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,234
If there's any trouble,
I can solve it.

422
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:08,727
OK.

423
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:13,561
You said I could find my ideal woman
from an audition.

424
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:17,244
I appreciate it.

425
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,218
Hey, Aoyama.

426
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:27,870
Promise me one thing.
Don't call her.

427
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:31,322
Hopefully I'm wrong about this, but...

428
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,305
It's going to affect your whole life.

429
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:36,443
Don't be so hasty.

430
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,320
Cool down a bit.

431
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,261
Alright. I promise you.

432
00:41:57,924 --> 00:41:59,679
You're not sick, are you?

433
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,707
It is rare for you to take a day off.

434
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:07,351
Since I've worked for you,
I've never seen you like this.

435
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:09,403
Oh well...

436
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:15,100
It's good to have a break.
You might be a little tired.

437
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:20,192
Since your wife died,
you've worked very hard for your son.

438
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:23,233
Forming your own company,
which is doing quite well.

439
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,755
You work too much.

440
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:33,187
I wish my husband was like you.
My life would be easier.

441
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:39,546
You must have a nice girlfriend.

442
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:00,923
I'm sure you do.

443
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,948
Men can't maintain without
female support.

444
00:43:44,482 --> 00:43:48,952
I've finished.
I'm going home.

445
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:51,061
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

446
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:10,357
I'm leaving.

447
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:13,561
See you.

448
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:23,026
Oh? What is it?

449
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,738
Not really.
See you tomorrow.

450
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,375
Bye.

451
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,796
This is Aoyama.

452
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:22,168
Really?

453
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:26,944
Good. I thought you wouldn't
phone me anymore.

454
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:33,494
If I told the truth, you might think
that I'm a heavy woman.

455
00:46:34,434 --> 00:46:37,532
I've been longing for your call.

456
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:40,802
Sorry.

457
00:46:42,145 --> 00:46:44,216
So how are you?

458
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,707
What?

459
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,169
What's so funny?

460
00:46:51,677 --> 00:46:56,703
I never thought about having a date
with you again. So I'm pretty excited.

461
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,701
Here we go.

462
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:28,764
I never asked you about your family.
Are they fine?

463
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:32,638
- They're fine.
- You're from Tokyo, right?

464
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:36,541
They bought a house in Chiba.
Just moved in last month.

465
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,665
My father loves golf, living
in Chiba is more convenient.

466
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:44,252
- Really?
- We are not that close.

467
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:46,937
But not that distant either.
Quite an average family.

468
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:51,320
- Do you still work at the bar?
- Yes.

469
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:53,430
Is that in Ginza?

470
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:57,410
It's on 4th street.
Called the Stone Fish. Funny name.

471
00:47:57,602 --> 00:47:58,532
The Stone Fish?

472
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,479
Shall I come for a drink?

473
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,100
Thank you... but...

474
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:06,876
...the owner interferes with
my private things.

475
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,355
If you don't want me to come
of course I won't.

476
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,174
I'm just curious about you.

477
00:48:14,462 --> 00:48:18,653
I won't lie to you,
definitely not.

478
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,542
I promise.

479
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,144
I have to tell you...

480
00:48:24,963 --> 00:48:27,812
Can I tell you the truth
about the movie?

481
00:48:28,003 --> 00:48:33,978
- Someone else got the part?
- It's not like that. The movie itself.

482
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:41,919
Actually the sponsor didn't like
some of the story.

483
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:45,506
We had to suspend it.

484
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:53,754
In the worst case it might
not come out.

485
00:48:55,259 --> 00:48:58,683
Oh really?
You might be hurt.

486
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:02,491
Not me. But you might be.

487
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:06,691
You read my composition,
didn't you?

488
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:10,777
I never thought I'd get the main part.

489
00:49:11,812 --> 00:49:15,668
It's OK. The good thing is
that I met you.

490
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:20,127
I felt wonderful seeing
myself in the mirror.

491
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:26,812
Joining images of myself
and beautiful things.

492
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:32,345
That's incredible, I trained
myself hard to release pain.

493
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:38,809
That's why I could
tolerate hard lessons.

494
00:49:39,682 --> 00:49:43,451
But eventually I lost
my precious ballet.

495
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:58,201
It's hard to forget about it.

496
00:49:58,978 --> 00:50:03,284
But someday you'll feel
that life is wonderful.

497
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:08,348
That's life, isn't it?

498
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:24,441
Thank you.

499
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:29,053
Living alone is a hassle.

500
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:32,765
I have nobody to talk with.

501
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:37,052
There were some guys
that approached me.

502
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:43,094
But you are the first one
to support me.

503
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:48,829
Warmly wrapping me and
trying to understand me.

504
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:54,650
- Let's have dinner soon.
- When will that be?

505
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:59,282
Sorry. Am I pushing you?

506
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,390
I'll call you.

507
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,507
Yes, I'll wait for you.

508
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:19,959
Here is fine.

509
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,230
Please stop the car.
She's getting off.

510
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:32,149
- Thank you very much for today.
- See you.

511
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:39,859
- Good night.
- Bye.

512
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:51,732
Take me to Okusawa.

513
00:52:14,816 --> 00:52:15,680
Yes?

514
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:21,530
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- What?

515
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,212
Well well, the drapes are dirty.

516
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:31,283
What?

517
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,510
Well...

518
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,358
You found a girlfriend.

519
00:52:40,068 --> 00:52:41,075
Am I right?

520
00:52:42,015 --> 00:52:42,878
Bingo.

521
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,469
You look a little different,
sometimes you even smile.

522
00:52:53,763 --> 00:52:56,439
She is only 24 years old.

523
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,244
She's closer to my age.
Must be very beautiful.

524
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,684
I'm the same as you.
I like the beautiful ones.

525
00:53:05,857 --> 00:53:07,036
Don't get fooled.

526
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,460
I'm much cleverer than you.

527
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:14,267
Have you proposed to her?

528
00:53:15,677 --> 00:53:16,761
Not yet.

529
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:21,115
We are going away this weekend.
I'm going to propose to her then.

530
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:22,688
Good luck!

531
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:28,030
I'll introduce her to you soon.

532
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:34,071
Let me check her out first.
I trust my hunches.

533
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:39,126
Because you're blind in love now.

534
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:45,913
Well, what can we do before dinner?

535
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:51,418
I know the chef here is very good.

536
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:54,583
He provides very nice food.

537
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:59,579
But he has a terrible mouth.

538
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:08,125
There is a little museum close by.

539
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:13,112
If we leave now,
we could still make it.

540
00:55:30,978 --> 00:55:33,788
It's about 20 minutes By car.

541
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:42,458
After that, we could go
to the harbour.

542
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:48,702
It's a little harbour,
but it has a nice coffee shop.

543
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:52,471
They serve nice cheesecake.

544
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:54,676
Their desserts are...

545
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,587
Come to me.

546
00:57:04,993 --> 00:57:06,240
Please.

547
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,087
Don't take off your clothes yet.

548
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:34,464
Please...

549
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,260
Look at my body.

550
00:58:15,684 --> 00:58:20,287
I burnt myself when I was little.

551
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:29,408
I want you to know all about me.

552
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:48,215
You are very beautiful.

553
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:57,076
Please love me.
Only me.

554
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:00,759
I understand.

555
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:05,276
Everybody says so.

556
00:59:06,782 --> 00:59:11,155
But I hope you are different
from the others.

557
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:14,195
Only me.

558
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,931
OK?

559
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:22,145
Only me. Please love me.
Only me.

560
01:01:19,331 --> 01:01:20,280
Yes.

561
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:24,087
Is that Mr. Aoyama?
This is the front desk.

562
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:25,689
Yes.

563
01:01:25,794 --> 01:01:28,470
I'm terribly sorry.
You must be in bed.

564
01:01:29,084 --> 01:01:33,755
We tried calling many times
but there was no answer.

565
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,670
Your partner has left.

566
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:39,835
We want to confirm your stay.

567
01:01:40,123 --> 01:01:42,463
Sorry to call you so late,
but we need to know.

568
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,625
Left?

569
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:57,817
What you are saying is
she disappeared?

570
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:05,144
Nobody answers the phone.
There's no way to contact her.

571
01:02:06,525 --> 01:02:11,761
I don't know exactly
where she lives either.

572
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:21,726
- What happened in the hotel?
- I told you all about it.

573
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:24,440
But normally people don't
disappear like that.

574
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,179
We might have misunderstood
each other somehow.

575
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:36,255
I just want to talk to her
face to face.

576
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:42,777
Yoshikawa, can you find out
her address?

577
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:48,761
Aoyama,
I've only got her resume.

578
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:51,092
It's impossible.

579
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:57,536
- Why don't you forget about her.
- I can't do that.

580
01:02:57,824 --> 01:02:59,867
I can't finish everything like this.

581
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,936
I know I can't convince you but...

582
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,347
I suggest you forget about her.

583
01:03:19,422 --> 01:03:20,831
You're saying...

584
01:03:21,627 --> 01:03:23,229
...that I...

585
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:28,734
...went too crazy about
a young girl.

586
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:34,977
Eventually being left alone
like a pathetic old fart?

587
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,075
Yes, you are.

588
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:47,224
What's the matter with you? You said
that you weren't born yesterday.

589
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:51,904
Whatever problems come up,
you fix them, right? Oh come on!

590
01:03:58,148 --> 01:03:59,289
What?

591
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,959
- It's OK.
- What's OK about it?

592
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:08,985
It's OK now.
I won't ask your help anymore.

593
01:04:10,174 --> 01:04:12,217
I'll look for her.

594
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,377
- I'll look for her myself.
- Aoyama!

595
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:59,258
"Shimada Ballet Studio"

596
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:34,291
Excuse me?

597
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,399
Excuse me, but...

598
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:30,585
Excuse me.

599
01:07:35,773 --> 01:07:36,703
Are you...

600
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,760
Are you Mr. Shimada?

601
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:47,771
I'm the one who called you
this afternoon.

602
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:58,262
About Miss Asami Yamazaki.

603
01:07:58,493 --> 01:08:00,123
Go home.

604
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:09,982
Let me be frank with you.

605
01:08:10,557 --> 01:08:16,340
Did you have any problems
with Asami before?

606
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,941
I just want to know
how to contact her.

607
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,775
And I'm looking for a clue.

608
01:08:44,603 --> 01:08:48,248
Did you see her?

609
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:51,959
Yes.

610
01:08:58,394 --> 01:09:00,917
Did you hear her voice?

611
01:09:03,228 --> 01:09:05,817
What do you mean by that?

612
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,254
Did you touch her body?

613
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,570
Did you hold her in your arms?

614
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:22,648
How was that?

615
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,813
Was it good?

616
01:09:31,261 --> 01:09:33,438
Did you smell her?

617
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:05,431
Asami...

618
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:30,328
Go home.

619
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,816
4th Street.
The Stone Fish.

620
01:10:48,732 --> 01:10:51,734
"The Stone Fish"

621
01:11:49,698 --> 01:11:51,041
No one is there.

622
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:59,384
Are you closed today?

623
01:12:00,094 --> 01:12:02,616
That bar closed about a year ago.

624
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:13,367
That was huge mess.
The owner was murdered.

625
01:12:14,882 --> 01:12:18,623
Do you know an Asami
who used to work here?

626
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:22,114
Asami? I don't recall.

627
01:12:22,814 --> 01:12:26,161
Normally the owner worked
here alone.

628
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:31,320
Asami was supposed to be
working here 3 times a week.

629
01:12:31,905 --> 01:12:34,456
Some kind of a mistake.

630
01:12:35,674 --> 01:12:38,715
Excuse me...
Why was the owner killed?

631
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:47,672
I'm not sure but people talked about
some sort of man problem.

632
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:50,837
She used to be associated with
a music industry guy.

633
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:53,369
She used drugs too.

634
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:58,490
Did she get murdered here?

635
01:12:58,653 --> 01:13:01,338
The body was chopped up completely.

636
01:13:02,403 --> 01:13:07,351
It's a 28 year old building.
The whole thing is tilted.

637
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:11,351
We saw her blood flowing
through a gap in the door.

638
01:13:11,773 --> 01:13:14,679
The other mystery was...

639
01:13:16,577 --> 01:13:21,497
The police tried to recompose
her body together.

640
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:26,005
3 extra fingers and
an ear came up.

641
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:28,824
An extra tongue as well.

642
01:13:36,506 --> 01:13:39,230
Isn't it a terrible world?

643
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,320
Meal time, Gang.

644
01:14:14,043 --> 01:14:15,156
Bye.

645
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,888
Hi, this is Shigehiko.

646
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:13,810
I'm going to stay at
my friend's house tonight.

647
01:15:14,146 --> 01:15:17,627
It's none of my business,
but eat properly.

648
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:20,505
There's some yogurt there,
please have it.

649
01:15:22,787 --> 01:15:27,601
And Gang was hiding. Underneath
the house, please feed him.

650
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:29,213
Talk to you later.

651
01:16:58,691 --> 01:16:59,861
I'm sorry.

652
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:02,872
How have you been?

653
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:11,254
I never expected we would meet again.
Sorry to be childish.

654
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:20,759
I never asked you about your family.
Are they fine?

655
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:35,605
When I was little,
my parents got a divorce.

656
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:40,026
I was sent to my uncle's house.

657
01:17:42,107 --> 01:17:44,533
That was a terrible place.

658
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:51,390
I only remember being abused.

659
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:56,339
My uncle's wife was
that sort of woman.

660
01:17:58,363 --> 01:18:01,297
I have many scars.

661
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:11,194
If it's too painful,
you needn't talk about.

662
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:16,594
No, I want you to know
all about me.

663
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:24,477
I was forced into cold baths in winter,
and I got pneumonia.

664
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:31,900
She pushed me down the staircase.
I broke my shoulder bone.

665
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:37,885
The doctor worried about me.

666
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:42,680
He sent me back to
my mother's home.

667
01:18:46,717 --> 01:18:48,242
When was that?

668
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:52,251
I was 7 years old.

669
01:18:55,387 --> 01:18:56,663
Really.

670
01:19:03,932 --> 01:19:07,548
My mother had remarried.

671
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:12,631
I've reduced the scars.

672
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:18,135
But my stepfather...

673
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:21,972
Hated me so much.

674
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:27,966
He's got disabled legs.

675
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,545
Staying at home all the time.

676
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:39,867
I did nothing in a dark room everyday.

677
01:19:41,057 --> 01:19:45,334
Until my mother came home.

678
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,410
I'm sorry.

679
01:19:50,561 --> 01:19:54,521
It's not a normal story is it?

680
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:03,009
If you dislike me,
please say so.

681
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,080
Strange.

682
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:11,228
I never imagined you'd had
such an agonizing past.

683
01:20:12,417 --> 01:20:14,613
Because ballet supported me.

684
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:16,570
You had talent.

685
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:18,900
I'm not sure.

686
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:25,566
But when I danced,
it purified the dark side of me.

687
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:33,075
That's the reason why
I never tried to kill myself.

688
01:20:41,793 --> 01:20:44,574
I think... you're wonderful.

689
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:51,191
I've been looking for
someone like you.

690
01:20:53,502 --> 01:20:54,682
Darling.

691
01:21:02,786 --> 01:21:04,215
Ryoko.

692
01:21:06,497 --> 01:21:11,130
This is an opportune time.
Let me introduce you. This is Asami.

693
01:21:21,698 --> 01:21:25,074
No...
She isn't good for you.

694
01:21:27,615 --> 01:21:29,179
She's a very fine woman.

695
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:33,398
No... darling, no.

696
01:21:38,942 --> 01:21:41,531
I want...
I want you right now.

697
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:09,401
Asami.

698
01:22:23,873 --> 01:22:26,395
That was a little mistake.

699
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:30,998
You made love to me.
Only once.

700
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:35,199
I expected something from you.

701
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:38,584
Was I stupid?

702
01:22:39,486 --> 01:22:40,733
Sorry.

703
01:22:43,265 --> 01:22:44,569
Forgive me.

704
01:22:45,183 --> 01:22:48,894
I'll do anything to give
you pleasure.

705
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:53,306
I like doing this.

706
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,883
What are you doing!
Stop it.

707
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:06,234
Look, you've got a hard on.

708
01:23:06,943 --> 01:23:07,874
Stop it!

709
01:25:06,842 --> 01:25:09,269
3 extra fingers, an ear...

710
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:13,115
...and a tongue too.

711
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,789
You only love me.

712
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:47,228
Only me.

713
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:11,606
Asami.

714
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:16,958
Asami.

715
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:19,355
Dance for me.

716
01:26:23,067 --> 01:26:24,496
Dance.

717
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,519
Dance.

718
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:29,118
Dance, bitch!

719
01:26:29,723 --> 01:26:31,152
Dance...

720
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:33,789
...for me otherwise...

721
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:37,529
...I'll torture you!

722
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:42,334
Dance.

723
01:26:42,718 --> 01:26:44,377
Please.

724
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,060
Dance for me. Dance!

725
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,440
Asami...

726
01:27:05,504 --> 01:27:07,029
Good girl.

727
01:27:21,214 --> 01:27:22,393
Asami!

728
01:27:59,422 --> 01:28:00,764
This wire can...

729
01:28:01,378 --> 01:28:04,984
...cut meat and bone very easily.

730
01:28:23,714 --> 01:28:26,265
You are wonderful.

731
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:32,470
I never felt unhappy.

732
01:28:33,602 --> 01:28:38,263
Because I've been unhappy
all the time.

733
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:42,799
- Asami!
- Please stop!

734
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,341
No!

735
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:50,778
Males need female support.

736
01:28:51,229 --> 01:28:53,301
Otherwise they can't maintain.

737
01:28:53,502 --> 01:28:57,367
Let's have an audition.

738
01:29:05,826 --> 01:29:11,033
My son told me that I look old.
Why don't I remarry.

739
01:29:12,385 --> 01:29:14,841
That's why I decided.

740
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,758
Asami...

741
01:30:30,298 --> 01:30:31,861
You...

742
01:30:51,838 --> 01:30:54,111
You can't move any more.

743
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:58,810
I've paralyzed your body but
your nerves are still awake.

744
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:08,276
You can enjoy the pain
and suffer incredibly.

745
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:42,971
You guys collect many girls
from auditions.

746
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,522
Make them fail.

747
01:32:46,587 --> 01:32:49,455
You contact them later.

748
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:52,178
Just wanting to have sex.

749
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:55,353
Everybody is the same.

750
01:33:53,499 --> 01:33:55,446
Deeper, deeper...

751
01:34:00,414 --> 01:34:02,965
Deeper, deeper...

752
01:34:04,193 --> 01:34:05,593
Painful?

753
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:12,949
Words create lies.
Pain can be trusted.

754
01:34:15,586 --> 01:34:16,593
Right?

755
01:34:20,256 --> 01:34:25,435
You can feel pain. You can study
about the human body as well.

756
01:34:26,624 --> 01:34:27,670
Deeper...

757
01:34:31,324 --> 01:34:33,558
This is the most painful point.

758
01:34:36,925 --> 01:34:39,888
Am I right?
Then here too.

759
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:43,254
Here as well.

760
01:34:45,086 --> 01:34:46,064
Right?

761
01:34:46,908 --> 01:34:49,181
Deeper, deeper...

762
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:38,102
Deeper, deeper...

763
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:07,381
Deeper, deeper...

764
01:36:13,088 --> 01:36:17,010
Here we go. Underneath the
eyes is also very painful.

765
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:25,497
You only realize what kind
of man you are...

766
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:28,116
...when you feel pain,
you understand.

767
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:33,908
When you have a very
agonizing experience.

768
01:36:41,408 --> 01:36:45,148
Your son is called Shigehiko, right?

769
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:53,914
Your son has to suffer pain,
then you'll understand more.

770
01:36:55,295 --> 01:36:56,916
Stop that!

771
01:36:58,201 --> 01:37:01,749
Stay away from my son.

772
01:37:02,977 --> 01:37:06,074
You love your son, too?

773
01:37:06,976 --> 01:37:10,141
You're a liar.
You only love me, right?

774
01:37:11,646 --> 01:37:17,209
I've only got you.
But you have so many others.

775
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,210
I don't want to be
one of them.

776
01:37:28,286 --> 01:37:33,436
Even if I give you all of me,
you won't be mine completely.

777
01:37:35,546 --> 01:37:37,790
Everybody is the same.

778
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,408
Everybody.

779
01:37:41,818 --> 01:37:43,093
Everybody.

780
01:37:56,414 --> 01:37:59,992
You can't go anywhere
without feet.

781
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:12,239
This wire can cut
meat and bone easily.

782
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:19,892
Stop it!

783
01:39:52,382 --> 01:39:54,424
Right foot, please.

784
01:40:09,788 --> 01:40:11,313
I'm home.

785
01:40:11,869 --> 01:40:14,142
Dad, are you awake?

786
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:28,700
My friend got sick all of a sudden.
So we called an ambulance.

787
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:40,880
Are you there?

788
01:40:52,859 --> 01:40:54,997
What happened, Dad?

789
01:42:16,928 --> 01:42:18,865
What's going on?

790
01:42:29,914 --> 01:42:31,544
What happened?

791
01:42:32,378 --> 01:42:34,105
Are you OK?

792
01:42:49,919 --> 01:42:50,840
Well...

793
01:42:53,343 --> 01:42:54,801
I will...

794
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:58,742
I'll answer your proposal.

795
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:01,965
What?

796
01:43:05,465 --> 01:43:09,042
Your proposal...

797
01:43:10,682 --> 01:43:12,543
I accept.

798
01:43:17,376 --> 01:43:18,901
Proposal?

799
01:43:27,418 --> 01:43:29,556
It's like a dream.

800
01:43:32,194 --> 01:43:34,706
I'm so happy.

801
01:43:39,454 --> 01:43:41,726
I applied for the audition.

802
01:43:43,577 --> 01:43:45,591
I was the...

803
01:43:48,545 --> 01:43:50,195
...luckiest one.

804
01:43:52,669 --> 01:43:56,409
Because I didn't become
the heroine of the movie.

805
01:43:57,368 --> 01:43:59,987
But I became the real heroine.

806
01:44:25,497 --> 01:44:26,964
Deeper, deeper...

807
01:44:28,537 --> 01:44:30,714
What's wrong, Dad?

808
01:44:35,835 --> 01:44:37,082
Who the hell are you?

809
01:44:42,587 --> 01:44:44,659
What the hell do you want?

810
01:44:54,009 --> 01:44:54,940
What's going on?

811
01:45:48,569 --> 01:45:49,749
Dad!

812
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:53,038
Are you alright, Dad?

813
01:45:54,016 --> 01:45:55,091
Dad!

814
01:45:57,853 --> 01:45:59,704
Call the police...

815
01:45:59,905 --> 01:46:01,238
Police...

816
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:13,082
Is this the police? This is the Aoyama
residence, Okusawa.

817
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:15,221
Please send an ambulance.

818
01:46:16,698 --> 01:46:18,971
My father's been seriously injured.
And one woman too.

819
01:46:19,258 --> 01:46:21,464
I don't know the details.

820
01:46:23,162 --> 01:46:27,803
His left leg has been chopped off
and is bleeding badly.

821
01:46:31,707 --> 01:46:35,898
The address is Okusawa 6-20-4.

822
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:39,791
I thought you were very busy.

823
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:44,471
I don't know your job so well.

824
01:46:45,881 --> 01:46:50,638
I might sound heavy.

825
01:46:52,384 --> 01:46:56,239
But I've been waiting for
your call for a long time.

826
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:14,969
I never expected that
we would meet again.

827
01:47:15,228 --> 01:47:18,364
Sorry to have been childish.

828
01:47:20,608 --> 01:47:24,406
It's a hassle living alone.

829
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:29,172
I didn't have anybody to talk with.

830
01:47:31,743 --> 01:47:34,361
You are the first one to support me...

831
01:47:35,003 --> 01:47:37,372
Warmly wrapping me...

832
01:47:37,593 --> 01:47:40,662
Trying to understand me...

833
01:47:41,151 --> 01:47:44,862
It's hard to forget about.

834
01:47:50,521 --> 01:47:52,794
But someday you'll feel...

835
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:57,685
...that life is wonderful.

836
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:02,326
That's life, isn't it?
